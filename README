### README
# various setup dot-files to optimize (stupid word!) your bash environment---vim, git, screen, etc.

# to get this repository, go into $HOME:
$ cd
# and clone it:
$ git clone https://github.com/gitliver/.dotfiles.git
# it will create an invisible directory: .dotfiles/
# containing a bunch of dotfiles

# To make them active, link to them from your $HOME as follows:
$ cd
$ ln -s .dotfiles/.bash_profile 
$ ln -s .dotfiles/.screenrc
$ ln -s .dotfiles/.vimrc 
$ ln -s .dotfiles/.gitconfig 

# also, to make sure the unix utility "screen" works, make sure .bashrc sources .bash_profile like such:
$ cat ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bash_profile

# It's useful (but not necessary) to use this script in combination with another repository: 
$ git clone https://github.com/gitliver/.bash_prefs.git

# The reason is that the file .dotfiles/.bash_profile sources some additional files in that repo.
